This is a design for a software component (containing multiple sub-components) that computes the difference
in days between two dates (days_between_dates).

days_between_dates(date1, date2):
    if date1 is in the same year as date2:
        return days_between_dates_in_year(date1, date2)
    
    otherwise:
        answer = days_between_dates_in_year(date1, December 31 of same year as date1)
        answer = answer + 1 # To get to January 1 of the next year
        for each year y between date1 and date2 (exclusive):
            answer = answer + number_of_days_in_year(y)
        answer = answer + days_between_dates_in_year(January 1 of same year as date2, date2)
        return answer

number_of_days_in_year(y):
    if is_leap_year(y):
        return 366
    otherwise:
        return 365

is_leap_year(y):
    # A leap year occurs every year that's a multiple of 4,
    # except for years that are divisible by 100 but not 400.
    # (Yes, this is a true fact. See the below reference.)
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year

    if y is divisible by 4:
        if y is divisible by 100 and y is not divisible by 400:
            return false
        otherwise:
            return true
    otherwise:
        return false # Not divisible by 4

days_between_dates_in_year(date1, date2):
    if date1's month is the same as date2's month:
        return date2's day - date1's day
    otherwise:
        answer = days_in_month(date1's month) - date1's day # To get to the end of date1's month
        answer = answer + 1 # To get to the first of the NEXT month
        for each month m between date1 and date2 (exclusive):
            answer = answer + days_in_month(m, date1's year) # To get past month m
        answer = answer + date2's day - 1 # To get to date2's day

days_in_month(m, y):
    if m is in ['Sep', 'Apr', 'June', 'Nov']:
        return 30 # These months all have 30 days
    otherwise if m is NOT 'Feb':
        return 31 # These months all have 31 days
    otherwise:
        # m must be February. If it's a leap year, it has 29 days.
        # Otherwise, it has 28 days.
        if is_leap_year(y):
            return 29
        otherwise:
            return 28
